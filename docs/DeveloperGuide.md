## **Introduction**

nustracker is a standalone desktop app that aims to help event directors and administrative personnel of
NUS student organisations to manage the organisation of undergraduate student events more easily.

As this app is geared towards the tech-literate generation, it is designed to use
a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to speed up usage for fast typists, while still making use of a
clean Graphical User Interface (GUI).

NUSTracker allows event directors to manage student events attendance information of the large undergraduate
student base.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete id/e1234567`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)
<br>_Sequence diagram of execution of delete id/e1234567_

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nustracker/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `EventListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart<T>` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.


The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework and heavily utilizes CSS as well. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The styling for the UI components is controlled by the [`DarkTheme.css`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css) and [`LightTheme.css`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/LightTheme.css) files. These .css files
are also switched for every component whenever the user requests a change in theme, via the `ThemeApplier`.

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete id/e0123456")` API call.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e.,
  * all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
  * all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' 
* similarly, stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' 
* the UI is bound to these lists so the UI can automatically update when the data in either list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nustracker.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Creating an event
This is a feature to allow the user to create an event. Currently, each event has a name, date, time, participant list and blacklist. Users can specify the name, date and time of an event using the `create` command.

This feature comes with the following classes:
- nustracker.logic.commands.CreateCommand
- nustracker.logic.parser.CreateCommandParser
- nustracker.model.event.*

The following sequence diagram shows how the create operation works:<br>

![CreateSequenceDiagram](images/CreateSequenceDiagram.png)
_Sequence diagram for creating an event_<br>

* Note that LogicManager is called using execute("create n/Orientation d/08-01-2021 t/1000"). This information was truncated to reduce clutter in the diagram.<br>
* The event is only added if there are no other events in the model that have the same name. This is checked using the `hasEvent` method.

The following sequence diagram shows how a create operation gets its arguments from the prefixes:

![CreateParseArguments](images/CreateParseArguments.png)
_Sequence diagram for parsing a create command's arguments_

AddressBook contains a UniqueEventList to hold a list of events. UniqueEventList implements the [`Iterable<Event>`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Iterable.html) interface and stores events in an [`ObservableList<Event>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/javafx/collections/ObservableList.html).

The following sequence diagram shows how an event is added to the UniqueEventList through the Model:

![AddEventToStorageSequenceDiagram](images/AddEventToStorageSequenceDiagram.png) <br>
_Sequence diagram for adding an event to UniqueEventList_

* The UniqueEventList checks for duplicate events using the `hasEvent` method before adding the event.
* After the event is added, the UI is immediately updated and the new event is reflected as an `EventCard` in the `EventListPanel`.

### Enrolling a Student into an Event

This is a feature to allow the user to enroll a student into an event. Currently, the implementation allows for each student to be enrolled into any chosen event as long as 
he/she is not on that event's blacklist. A student could be enrolled into more than one event.

This feature comes with the following classes:
- nustracker.logic.commands.EnrollCommand
- nustracker.logic.parser.EnrollCommandParser

The following sequence diagram shows how the enroll operation works:
![EnrollSequenceDiagram](images/EnrollSequenceDiagram.png)
<br>_Sequence diagram for enrolling a student into an event_


### Exporting Feature

This is a feature to allow the user to export a given data field. Currently, the implementation only works for emails and can only export a csv file.

This feature comes with the following classes:
- nustracker.logic.commands.ExportCommand
- nustracker.logic.parser.ExportCommandParser
- nustracker.storage.Exporting


The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)
<br>_Sequence diagram for exporting_

#### Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Parameters are passed to the Exporting class to instruct it on how and what to export. There is only 1 Exporting class with 1 method.
    * Pros: Commands are free from clutter, and all exporting changes are done in the Exporting class (i.e. formatting the string, choosing a filetype etc.)
    * Cons: The Exporting class might become convoluted and complicated as it gets updated in the future.
* **Alternative 2**: Each command manages its own formatting and passes the formatted content to Exporting class.
    * Pros: Exporting class will have a very specific purpose and is very clear.
    * Cons: Changes to a specific filetype might incur changes in many commands. (e.g. if the way that we export csv files is changed, then every command that exports as a csv file will have to change)
* **Alternative 3**: Exporting class is extended to accommodate for filetypes, and also accounts for the formatting of the data.
    * Pros: Very structured, easy to extend and add new commands that require export. Easy to add new filetypes for exporting and change which filetypes different commands use.
    * Cons: Takes longer to implement than the other 2 options

In the end the first choice was chosen as it was more structured, and take less time to implement than alternative 3. I would consider alternative 3 to be the best long term option, and would implement it as such if time permitted.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete id/e1234567` command to delete the student with student ID "e1234567" in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete id/e1234567` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div><br>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.
</div><br>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `events`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `events`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    2. Double-click the jar file. <br>
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

## Manual test cases:

#### Create an event
0. Assumptions: Sample data is loaded / Orientation Camp event exists in app.
1. Test case 1: `create n/Orientation Camp d/10-08-2022 t/1030`
   1. Expected: Error message saying event already exists is displayed.
2. Test case 2: `create n/Practical Exam d/14-11-2021 t/1700`
   1. Expected: Practical Exam event is created and displayed at the bottom of event list.

#### Enrolling a student
0. Assumptions: Sample data is loaded / Sports Camp event and Student with student ID e1234567 exist in app.
1. Test case 1: `enroll id/e1234567 ev/This event does not exist`
   1. Expected: Error message saying event does not exist is displayed.
2. Test case 2: `enroll id/e1234567 ev/Sports Camp`
    1. Expected: Student is enrolled into the Sports Camp event and student ID e1234567 is displayed in its enrolled list.

#### Deleting an event
0. Assumptions: Sample data is loaded / Math Olympiad event exists in app.
1. Test case 1: `delete ev/This event does not exist`
    1. Expected: Error message saying event does not exist is displayed.
2. Test case 2: `delete ev/Math Olympiad`
    1. Expected: The Math Olympiad event is deleted and removed from the event list.

#### Deleting a student

0. Assumptions: Sample data is loaded / Student with student ID e1234567 exists in app.
1. Test case 1: `delete id/e1234567 ev/Orientation Camp`
   1. Expected: Error message saying delete command can only delete either a student or event at one time is displayed.
2. Test case 2: `delete id/e1234567`
   1. Expected: Student with student ID "e1234567" is deleted and removed from the student list.

#### Exporting a list of emails
0. Assumptions: Sample data is loaded / The currently displayed student list is not empty.
1. Test case 1: `export fn/Emails`
   1. Expected: A file Emails.csv is created in the /data folder in your root directory where the app is run. The file will contain all the emails of the displayed students.

#### Test command inputs
1. Test extraneous prefixes:
   1. `students n/abc`: command ignores prefix and executes as expected
   2. `create n/Test event d/07-11-2021 t/1135 m/CS`: command does not accept extra prefixes and displayed invalid command message
   3. `add n/Jeremy m/CS id/e9556882 y/4 p/90121325 e/jeremy@u.nus.edu p/84756230`: command takes the latest prefix and creates a new student with phone number 84756230

    
2. Test invalid prefixes
   1. `delete id/1234567`: student ID requires an 'e' in front of 7 digits
   2. `blacklist id/e1234567 ev/Orientation Camp!`: event name only allows alphanumeric characters and spaces
   3. `add n/June m/BZA id/e8112233 y/1 p/81236540 e/june@a`: email's domain (after @) has to be at least 2 characters long

### Local Save File

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :label: **Note:** Before attempting these test cases related to the local save file, please
 set up **nustracker** to contain the sample data beforehand for the best experience. To do this, just delete the save file
named `addressbook.json` in the data folder, then open **nustracker** and type in a command to save the sample data into a save file.
</div>

1. Proper handling of a corrupted JSON save file

    1. Go to the folder containing the save data (The folder named: data) and open `addressbook.json`.

    1. Choose a comma in the file and add a close curly brace character to the right of it like this: `,}`. Save your edits.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: **nustracker** will not be able to load the data and the student and event lists are blank.


1. Proper handling of a JSON save file with missing data

    1. Go to the folder containing the save data (The folder named: data) and open `addressbook.json`.

    1. Choose a student in the file and delete one or more of the lines containing student data.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: **nustracker** will not be able to load the data and the student and event lists are blank.


1. Proper handling of a JSON save file with conflicting data

   i. Go to the folder containing the save data (The folder named: data) and open `addressbook.json`.

   ii. Choose a student in the file and take note of his/her student ID.

   iii. Choose an event in the file, and add this student ID into both the participants list as well as the blacklist.

   iv. If we choose a student with student ID `e0123456` and the event `Physics Camp`, the data in the JSON file should look like this:
   <br>

    ```
   Before:
    "participants" : [ ],
    "blacklist" : [ ]
    ```

    ```
   After:
    "participants" : [ "e0123456" ],
    "blacklist" : [ "e0123456" ]
    ```

   v. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
   Expected: **nustracker** will not be able to load the data and the student and event lists are blank.
