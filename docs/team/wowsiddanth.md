### Project: nustracker

![siddanth](names/siddanth.PNG)

__*nustracker*__ is an event-management software that was built specifically for the NUS student/manpower executive in mind. It is
a brownfield project that extends the AddressBook3 project, which is around 10kLoC.

* **New Feature**: Redesign Person class to behave like a Student class
  * **What it does**: Adds the necessary fields and methods so that the Person class behaves like a Student (_has a student ID, email, etc_)
  * **Justification**: This features redesigns the Person, so that it meets the specification of an NUS student, taking part in an event.
  * **Highlights**: This change affected almost many other class, as Person class is a fundamental component of the initial AddressBook3 project. It
  was definitely challenging adding these new attributes and tracing and fixing regressions.

* **New Feature**: Ability to add/delete student information
  * **What it does**: Adds the relevant methods and attributes that allowed for the deletion of every attribute of a student
  * **Justification**: This allows for the user to edit a specific wrong inputted field, instead of deleting and re-entering that particular student.
  * **Highlights**: This change affected many other classes, especially so the test cases. It was tough remaking a plethora of test cases and adding in new ones, to ensure stability.
  * **Credits**: -


* **New Feature**: Remake GUI to match mockup
  * **What it does**: Remakes the current GUI of the Main/Settings/Help window so that it matches the mockup proposed in _Figma_.
  * **Justification**: To beautify the product, and allow the user to have an elegant user experience.
  * **Highlights**: JavaFX, unlike many other frameworks for designing GUIs, is not as active as the rest. Thus, it was definitely tedious reading many articles and documentations posted by Oracle to gain an intuitive understanding. Additionally, it was also difficult as I had to learn CSS from scratch, from resources such as the Mozilla Foundation.
  * **Credits**: JavaFX documentation by Oracle, and the CSS resources by the Mozilla Foundation.


* **New Feature**: Add dark/light theme
  * **What it does**: Enables the user to toggle between a dark theme and a light theme.
  * **Justification**: To add another layer of customization for the user.
  * **Highlights**: This required an extensive CSS knowledge so similarly, I had to read and learn about CSS through
   videos and articles by the Mozilla Foundation.
  * **Credits**: CSS resources by the Mozilla Foundation.


* **New Feature**: Add profile picture
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to add profile pictures from added students.
  * **Justification**: To add another layer of customization for nustracker.
  * **Highlights**: This required the use of different JavaFX classes, and the information about manipulating the 
   different images types within storage. 
  * **Credits**: JavaFX Documentation


* **New Feature**: Add customizable glow around profile picture
  * **What it does**: Allows the user to customize the colour of the glow around the profile picture
  * **Justification**: To add another layer of customization
  * **Highlights**: This was implemented fully using JavaFX and the corresponding effects, and thus, it required me 
   to gain a deeper understanding of the styling elements offered by JavaFX.
  * **Credits**: JavaFX Documentation
